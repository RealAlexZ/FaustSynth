# FaustSynth: Monophonic MIDI Waveform Generator

## Overview
Welcome to FaustSynth, a dynamic monophonic MIDI waveform generator built using the Faust programming language. This is the project deliverable for PAT 481: Independent Study with Professor John Granzow in Fall 2023.

### Compiled With
- **JUCE:** 7.0.8
- **Faust:** 2.40.0
- **Plugin Gui Magic:** 1.4.1

## Features

### Waveform Generation
- **Types:** Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth

### Oscillator Mixing
- **Dual Oscillators:** Blend two oscillators with selectable waveforms
- **Mix Control:** Adjust the osc2Mix for desired oscillator balance

### Frequency and Detuning
- **MIDI Note Input:** Precise frequency control via MIDI
- **Detune Feature:** Adjustable detune amount for sonic richness

### Amplitude Envelope
- **ADSR Controls:** Customize Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release phases
- **Dynamic Sound Shaping:** Control over the amplitude's temporal evolution

### Filter Processing
- **Filter Types:** Bypass, Lowpass, and Highpass options
- **Cutoff Frequency:** Adjustable with LFO modulation for added depth

### LFO Modulation
- **Versatile LFO:** Adjustable frequency and depth
- **Parameter Modulation:** Adds complexity and variation to the sound
